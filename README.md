# Objective-C Class Category Template

This is the Objective-C class category template that Xcode 6 **so kindly removed...**

Clearly, Apple wants us to welcome our Swift extension overlords.

# Installation

Check out to wherever your Xcode templates live, e.g:
/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates

# License

I don't assume any ownership of this! Yanked right from Xcode.app 5.1.1
